## NasaSearch

The feature which was not added was pagination. I had a go at it worked but the layout was just not right and due to the time constraint I had to save it to a Gist: https://gist.github.com/ElAndy94/1a72bcd8bbef671733ad1c6ea3bff633 This will show that I did attempt it and had it all in place but due to the time constraint I did not manage to make it look good in enough time. 

This project has been created with pure custom css, no bootstrap. So all animations on buttons etc has all been created by me. Due to using custom css it took a tiny bit longer. The thing that took most my time was when creating the form in the NasaSearch container, I tried to create a form which was better for scalability but I came across some issues unfortunately, therefore I had to keep to the normal React Docs Forms and was not able to create an advanced form. 

The Button component is completely reusable and need types can be added to the buttons which is great, apart from that it was a fairly small project so I couldnt get much more reusable components, the Input one is reusable but due to my last minute fixes it is not getting used, could have been removed completely. 

I hope you enjoy the little project I have created, It has taken me roughly 8hours in total to create.
